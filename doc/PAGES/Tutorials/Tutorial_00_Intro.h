 ## Examples taken from the regression-test suite

 Examples from the regression-test suite (folder ``tests``) may also serve as
 additional tutorials in order for users to learn about additional possibilities
 offered by chi-tech and its physics modules.

 However, remember that those are regression tests that are meant to run fast.
 Hence, you may want to revise the phase-space resolution
 (e.g., mesh, angle, energy) and the iteration parameters (tolerance, number of
 iterations, etc.) in your own input files in order to reach a satisfactory answer for
 modeling purposes.

 \e Note: The selection below does not include all regression tests.
